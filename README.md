# ReactNativeBookRecords
React Native project for keeping track of books;

I've created this app for myself to keep track of the books I own. Currently it only works for my account but I'll be adding AWS Cognito accounts to it soon.
Currently you can Scan and add books by barcode to add to your owned books list and search by book title to add books to your TBR.
